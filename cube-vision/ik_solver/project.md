Screw-Seeker Xlerobot

Project Description:
In the Intelligent Robotics Lab at CU Boulder, an automated electric car battery recycling solution is being developed.
Currently, this solution involves a UR-5 robotic arm for screw removal, and a humanoid robot for tasks normally handled by humans.

One task that is not currently being handled by either robot is removal of screws once they are unscrewed.
This could be done by the humanoid, but pulling screws out is a rather complex grasping action for humanoid style robot hands.

The gripper of the LeRobot So-101 arm, which is excellent for small object pick-up, can pick up screws fairly easily.

The XLeRobot kit is made up of 3 parts:

Lerobot Lekiwi : An SO-101 arm and a swedish wheel base, representing the XLeRobot's navigation and the right gripper arms.

An additional standalone LeRobot SO-101, which serves as the left gripper.

Adjustable head: A mounted Realsense Camera with RGBD. Able to locate an object, estimate its depth and therefore location in 3d space.
